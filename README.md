The **Information Division**’s goal is to serve Andela’s business units by providing a scalable and smooth pipeline of partner-ready developers that exceed expectations. 

The **Technology Department** is the engine of scale at Andela with a strategic focus on capturing data, putting things into systems and increasing productivity.

The **Engineering Team** at Andela drives the implementation and delivery of improvements to that engine.
