### Background
***
Congratulations on completing the interview process (or simulations in the case of Fellows!), and starting your first day with the Andela Engineering team. We are so excited that you are here! This page is designed to help you navigate the onboarding process in your first two weeks, and the tasks you will complete at each stage of the process.

### Day 1
***
#### Onboarding Slack App
***
Our Engineering team created a Slack app to facilitate access granting to critical software used by the team. The app name is `@eng-onboarding`.  You can use the following slash command directly from Slack:
* `/eng-onboard [slack_handle] [github_handle]`. e.g `/eng-onboard @brice andela-bnkengsa`

The bot will perform the following actions:
* Add new team member to `@engineering` slack user group.
* Invite new team member to `#technology` and `#ask-technology` slack channels.
* Add new team member to all engineering repos on github.
* Add new team member to all engineering Pivotal Tracker boards

#### Software Access
***
As great as our onboarding bot is, it isn't quite a magician (yet!). There are still a couple systems you will need access to, that are not currently being covered by the bot. Reach out to Brice to grant you access to the following:
* `engineering@andela.com` Google Group.
* `engineering-credentials` folder on LastPass. This contains login credentials to accounts shared by the whole team, e.g. _CodeClimate_, _Bugsnag_, and _Test Users Credentials_.

#### Team Introduction
***
* Reach out on slack to introduce yourself to the rest of the team
* Reach out on #technology slack channel to introduce yourself to the entire tech team

#### Agile Team Meetings
***
* Reach out to the Technical Team Lead (TTL) or Product Lead (PL) to get invited to all recurring agile team meetings
    * Daily stand-ups
    * Weekly sprint planning
    * Weekly demos & retrospectives

_If you are not sure who the TTL or PL is, and/or which team you've been assignment to, please reach out to the [Director of Engineering](https://andela.slack.com/messages/@brice/)_

### Week 1
***
#### Communication
***
Excellent communication is the bread and butter of any good engineering team. On the Andela engineering team, we put a strong emphasis on communicating **early**, **often**, and in **public**. We encourage team members to raise issues early and often. 

#### Environment Setup
***
Within your first week, you are expected to have fully setup your development environment. Find details on how to setup your dev environment [here](https://github.com/andela/development-toolkit)

#### First Contribution
***
Within your first week, you are expected to have made your first contribution by updating our documentation.
* Update documentation of 2 [microservices](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook/wiki/Service-Registry), to follow our [README](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook/wiki/Conventions#repo-readme) convention.
* Update our [engineering wiki](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook/wiki) with any information you come across during onboarding that is missing

In order to continuously improve our onboarding process, we measure how long it takes each new team member to make their first contribution. Once your first commit has been merged and deployed, update our [Time To First Commit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GE01c8pSg5Hq4bsVfor6I-MvvzdaLAPsAV8w7K4CY94/edit#gid=0) sheet.

### Week 2
***
#### Engineering Playbook
***
Read through our [engineering playbook](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook) to get a feeling of how we work. Some key things to note:
- [Ownership](https://github.com/andela/decisions/issues/36): our teams own the implementation of solutions end to end, from frontend to microservices to testing.
- [Agile Process](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook/wiki/Agile-Process): Describes in detail how we work as a team
- [Conventions](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook/wiki/Conventions): The conventions we follow working as a team
- [Confidentiality](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook/wiki/Confidentiality): All data you have access to as part of your work on your project must remain confidential. Sharing any data outside of your team may be grounds for dismissal.
