Technology is the bread and butter of Andela. We train technologists, we work to create new forms of technology and we service Partnerâ€™s technology needs. In the interest of helping others understand our work and to be role models, we should work to be as open as possible

# Slack Etiquette / Best Practices for Communication

* Don't use `@channel`, use `@group-name` if possible or `@here` before `@channel`
* To notify the entire engineering team use `@engineering` handle
* To notify the entire technology team (PLs, TTLs, SSEs) use `@tech-team` handle
* Slack Reactions are your friend. Always better than adding a new acknowledgement message if it can be solved with an emoji reaction that's clear
* For non technical people: When reporting a bug. Please use this format: `I have noticed [unexpected data/behavior], this is impacting [system] which has [adverse effect] on [business function]`
