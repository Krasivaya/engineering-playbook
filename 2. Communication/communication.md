Technology is the bread and butter of Andela. We train technologists, we work to create new forms of technology and we service Partner’s technology needs. In the interest of helping others understand our work and to be role models, we should work to be as open as possible

# Slack Etiquette / Best Practices for Communication

* Don't use `@channel`, use `@group-name` if possible or `@here` before `@channel`
* To notify the entire engineering team use `@engineering` handle
* To notify the entire technology team (PLs, TTLs, SSEs) use `@tech-team` handle
* Slack Reactions are your friend. Always better than adding a new acknowledgement message if it can be solved with an emoji reaction that's clear
* For non technical people: When reporting a bug. Please use this format: `I have noticed [unexpected data/behavior], this is impacting [system] which has [adverse effect] on [business function]`
* **Technical Support:**
  * *Taking ownership* - when users and other stakeholders raise questions or raise issues (whether on Slack, Intercom or other channels), any team member can respond, and don't have to wait for PM or TTL.
  * *Being polite* - when a user reports an issue, it's important that you acknowledge for caring to do that in the first place. This makes them feel comfortable. So something like `Hi [Stakeholder's name], thank you for raising the issue.`, etc, is good.
  * *Timelines* - it's very important that you keep your word whenever you promise to get back to a user. For instance on Slack, you could use the *remind*, *star message* or *mark as unread* features to help you follow up. For P0 bugs, it's important that users get regular feedback on what is being done so far (preferably hourly).
