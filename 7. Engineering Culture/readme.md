A collection of *practices*, *behaviours*, and *interactions* that make up the culture of our work environment.

## Trust
- We support and make decisions to make Andela a success
- We figure out the best way to work with each other
- We find our own solutions to complex problems

## Ownership
- We identify and attack problems ourselves, rather than seeing them as someone else’s responsibility
- We treat technical debt as picking up the trash. We pick up the trash everywhere we go
- We capture any work we do in tickets, i.e. no ticket no work
- We can deploy code to production ourselves, and stay responsible for incidents and errors
- We promote a culture of no blame and no fear

## Simplicity
- We don’t over-engineer and we don’t cut corners
- We don’t sacrifice quality for velocity
- We believe simplicity allows for transparency, reuse and easy knowledge transfer
- We believe removing complexity takes time and needs to be done iteratively

## Iteration
- We demo and release often
- We use ways of gaining data-driven insight to verify our assumptions
- We hypothesize, measure, analyze, learn, adjust

## Collaboration
- We favor direct communication and avoid unnecessary layers in communication
- We offer direct responses to requests versus no response  
- We consistently ask questions in various channels to seek clarity and vet all assumptions
- We work together collaboratively, knowing that when we rise or fall, we do it as a team
- We reach out to anyone (and everyone) openly whenever we need help or unblocking
- We share gained knowledge and experiences across teams
- We believe in super teams over super-heros
