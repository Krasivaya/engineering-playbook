The following values guide our *decision-making* in everything we do and a sense of what's right.

## Simplicity
When contributing code, we always ask ourselves the question: “Could this be simpler?”


Simple solutions are easier to understand, especially since as our codebase grows, we often spend more time reading than writing code. Having code that’s easy to reason about enables us to more quickly spot bugs and make modifications with confidence.
Quality
Code should be seen by a fresh pair of eyes. Before any commit is deployed to production, it is code reviewed by another engineer.

High quality code stays that way through tests. While we prefer quality over quantity when it comes to tests, we strive to maintain at least 90% code coverage in our tests.

## Pragmatism
We put users needs before our wants. As engineers, we’re prone to tinkering with the shiniest tools and technologies. Ultimately, the customer is our North Star, and we’ve found that using proven tools and technologies often turns out to be best for the customer.

Code should never be hacked together nor over engineered. We think long term about the software we develop, and we’ll never ship if we feel we’re risking the customer experience.

## Ship fast, Sustainably
We ship code to production early and often. We strive to deliver value to our users consistently. We aspire to create engineering teams that are disciplined.

## Humility & Service
We’re here to use software to improve the lives of our users. It’s important that we actively look for opportunities to serve them, because they may not know what’s possible.

We take pride in what we accomplish, but we always maintain a sense of humility. 

We value everyone’s ideas. We foster an environment where the opinions of those who are not as vocal are heard equally.
